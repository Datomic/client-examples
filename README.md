## Client Examples

A collection of samples and tutorials for learning the
[Datomic](http://datomic.com) Client API at a Clojure REPL.

## Getting Started

Start a REPL with Datomic Client and Clojure 1.9.x+ on the classpath
(see build.boot for how to do this with boot).

Work through some of the examples in the examples directory,
evaluating each form at the REPL.
